# docker-nginx-php5-fpm
Dockerfile for nginx and php-fpm together.

Composer is also installed for convenience.

Doc root is in `/usr/share/nginx/html` so mounting files there will get them served. 
This can be overridden by setting the env NGINX_ROOT in the container or when building an image from this one.
